# Hi there, I'm Jay! 🎨✨

> I’m a creative developer who lives at the intersection of logic and aesthetics. 
> I don't just write code; I build digital experiences, experimental tools, and (occasionally) chaos.

### 🧪 Current Experiments
*What I’m currently "cooking" in the lab:*

* **FitHype**: HypeFit is a social platform designed specifically for the "Outfit of the Day" (#OOTD) culture. While Instagram is for your general life, HypeFit is a specialized digital runway where every post is a structured breakdown of a look. It combines the visual appeal of Instagram with the utility of a fashion database..

### 💼 Finished Projects
* **The Vault**: A premium, local-first code snippet library designed for the modern developer. Built with a "Glassmorphism" aesthetic, The Vault provides a high-performance workspace to archive, search, and manage your most valuable code artifacts..
